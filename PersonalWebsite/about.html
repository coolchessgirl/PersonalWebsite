  		<p class = "about-me">I am a sophmore, and my favorite subject in school is obviously computer science. Some clubs I enjoy are Coding Lady Colonials, Computer Team, and Chess Club. At home, I like learning about virtual reality, game design, web design, and algorithms. </p>
  		<p class = "about-me" >I started programming when I began learning Python 2 in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it. In middle school, I started a coding club with my friends so that we could develop cool things together. Soon, our club started to grow and we became instructors that gave weekly lessons to other middle school kids.</p> 
  		<p class = "about-me">One day in middle school, my friends gave me the nickname "Loaner Shoes" when I forgot to wear sneakers to gym class and needed to borrow loaner shoes from the locker rooms. Some people would also spell it "Loner Shoes" because all computer science nerds are loners, right? I hated the nickname, but it always stuck with me. In 2015, I founded Loner Shoes Studios and published my first Android game. </p>
